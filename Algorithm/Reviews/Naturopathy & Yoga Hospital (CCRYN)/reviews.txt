Generally found focus on the task at hand is not professional and undivided, typical sarkari place and same goes with the attitude of all people from Doctor till Handler. Okay if one can live with the slow pace, @times broken instruments and lax attitude. I guess reasonably priced and for places like these location near Home matters. Though they say 1.5 hrs for procedures but actual procedures are around 15-30 Minutes rest is wait time.
